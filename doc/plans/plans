* reactivate mov simplification
* static variables in other classes (not just base_class)
* explicit constructors in tree
	* transformation step to insert after parsing
	* skip if already explicit
	* ...or merge first assignment  A a = A(...)
* amd64: return (float,float) etc

* [1,2]==[1] -> [true,false]
maybe rather:
* [1,2]== 1  -> [true,false]
