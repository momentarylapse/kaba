r13 - stack pointer
r14 - link register (Rücksprung addresse?)
r15 - program counter

r4-r11 müssen wieder hergestellt werden

r0-r3 für Parameter (danach Stack)


This calling convention causes a "typical" ARM subroutine to
* In the prologue, push r4 to r11 to the stack, and push the return address in r14, to the stack. (This can be done with a single STM instruction).
* copy any passed arguments (in r0 to r3) to the local scratch registers (r4 to r11).
* allocate other local variables to the remaining local scratch registers (r4 to r11).
* do calculations and call other subroutines as necessary using BL, assuming r0 to r3, r12 and r14 will not be preserved.
* put the result in r0
* In the epilogue, pull r4 to r11 from the stack, and pulls the return address to the program counter r15. (This can be done with a single LDM instruction).
